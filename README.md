### Introduction
#### A lot of people have been affected by this pandemic and have to spend a lot of time at home. Most of the people have someone to accompany them, and among them there are some; who are  more lucky; to have their pets give them company. Pets are adorable creatures, who help you lighten your mood and bring joy on your face. They are amazing companions and especially pets like dog. Still people need human friends and with the world somewhat starting to recover from this and people starting to go out and move around they can make new friends with help of their dogs.
